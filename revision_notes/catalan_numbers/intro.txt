catalan numbers comes when you have to create non overlapping sequences,non crossing sequences,
for example consider this problem ,where there are n people sitting around a circle,how many non crossing handshakes can you make,
no crossing means,
lets take n=6;
crossing means if you make a handshake from 1 to 5 then number 6 has to make handshake with either 2 or 3 or 4 right but if you perform any of these 
handshakes,you will cross the 1 to 5 handshake, this shouldn't happen,
if this should n't happen means ,you have to shake hands with persons which has even difference inbetween them like
(1,4),(1,2),(1,6)
so number of ways of making handshakes when n==6 is
(1–2), (3–4), (5–6)

(1–2), (3–6), (4–5)

(1–4), (2–3), (5–6)

(1–6), (2–3), (4–5)

(1–6), (2–5), (3–4)
so there are 5 ways
and the code is given as

f(i,j)
{
let's assume i=1, j=6,
for(int k=i+1;k<=j;k+=2)
{
if(i-j<=1)if number of persons is less than or equal to 2 then only one way possible
return 1;
if i make handshake with k

int a=f(i+1,k-1);how many ways of shaking hands on left side means from person i+1,k-1
int b=f(k+1,j);how many ways of shaking hands on right side means from person k+1 to j;
count+=a*b;
}
return count;
}
catalan number recurrence,
for n people, number of handshakes is n/2
so cataln states that
if j=n/2;
f(j)
{
if(j<=1)
return 1;
for(int k=0;k<j;k++)
{
count+=f(i)*f(j-k-1);
it is same as number of ways on left *number ways on right
there we are taking persons here we are  taking handshakes so ,handsakes=(number of persons)/2;
}
return count;
}

we can apply this to number ways of writing valid parentheses of size n;
there also we can conside open and closeing paranthesis as people making hand shakes, one shouldn't cross other,
