/this is a good one,
the actual problem happens only with subarrays having same element
  so if we solve that ,we can solve this,because anyway the remaining subarrays are sorted
  to solve the subarrays with same elementlet's consider an example
  nums={2,2,2,2},k=2;
for(i=0;i<n;)we get
  res=1;(tis implies subarray [2,2,2,2] appears 1 time in given nums)(4-1+1)times
res+=2;(this implies subarray [2,2,2] appears 2 times in given nums)(4-3+1)times
res+=3;(this implies subarray [2,2] appears 3 times in given nums)(4-2+1)times
res+=4;(this implies subarray [2] appears 4 times in given nums)(4-1+1)times
so how to avoid taking duplicate subarrays
  for that let's iterate from l=1 to 4 since equal subarray len is 4
  if((l*nums[i])%k==0)
  that means if 1*2=2 is divisible by k then we need to remove it's duplicate sequences 
  for a subarray of len l,total sequences in a n array of n is given by n-l+1,we need to keep only instance of this sequence, so we need
  to remove remaining n-l sequences
  that's why we do
  res-=n-l;
  for all l from 1 to n and whose product is divisible by k
