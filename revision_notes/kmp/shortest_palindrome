here all we need is to understand kmp algorithm
everything we can understand in kmp algo rithm but the while loop part, wheneven a mismatch happens is explained here,
whenever we can't extend previous previx suffix, what we do is we go to the previous prefix from start like for this 
s="ababac" lps=0,0,1,2,3,?
when curr=='c';
c!=s[3]
so what we do is we go to the prefix of "aba" from beginning ,because it is also a suffix "aba",now in "aba" we ask what is the lps at idx 2 which is at last 
'a', because that prefix is also present at end of curr suffix, like for lps[2]=1(here) ,means char a is present at idx=4, so we just need to compare idx=1 with curr idx, value
,that's waht this lop does
