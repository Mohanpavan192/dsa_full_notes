first read the problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/
so basically the question states to find the max sum of sequence with no adjacent elements;
that means if i am at pos i, i can choose any idx from i-2 to 0,but how d i decide that,which has max value, what if i have a variable 
which stores the max of sums with no adjacent sums till i-2,let's call it odd_length,so odd_length has max value of all sequences(with no ad
  jacent elements),now all i need to do is add my current elemnt to it;that's it,
  now after performing this, i need to update even length too,what is even length?
  even_lenth is  avariable which holds the maximum sum of all subsequences with no adjacent element but it is adjacent to curr element ,so it's value 
  is used when we are dealing with next element, because for next element the current element's adjacent will not become adjacent right,
  so we do, odd_length=max(odd_length,even_length),to store max of all sequences so far, for next element,
  and update the even_length alsolike this
  class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int odd_length=0,even_length{0};
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            int temp=nums[i]+odd_length;
            odd_length=max(even_length,odd_length);
            even_length=temp;
        }
        return max(even_length,odd_length);
    }
};
