Sparse Tables are one of a kinf thing, which answers, range queries like min ,max or gcd for immutable arrays
means once table is built no update operation can be performed,because for every update it takes O(nlogn) to rebuild the table again
the thing is for every range
let L=1,R=11;
range=R-L+1=11;
11=1011;
so waht we do is we take the msb value ,which is 1000=8,so we have a precomputed range of
L to L+8,R-8+1 to R;
i mean with a interval defference of 8 and take the min or max of these values, how to precompute and explanation is given int his video

also do this question for practise
here the purpose of log array is to syore the MSB value for any value from 0 to n
as log[11]=8;that's why we create a log array
then we initialise our main min_r,max_r arrays with intial 1 digit len values, means there own values
To calculate a lenght of 2^j from any index,we need values of len 2^(j-1) from those index
that's why we start with j=1 to j=log(n) -->2^1 to 2^n ,ok,we only compute a max of 2 ^n from any index if that interval
exist, because anyway we are taking max or min of overlapping intervals right, so this will work
let's say you need min from range 1 to n
so now we laready have precomputed value 
j=n-1+1=n,max value is n only 
so it will be sufficient if we calculate a max interval of 2^n;
after taking j, we start from every index(i) and check if there exists an interval from i by using this
i+(1<<j)-1<n
1<<j is equal to 2^j,so we are just checking whether the end index of interval is less than n or not
if yes
simply we caclculate
min_r[i][j]=min(min_r[i][j-1],min_r[i+(1<<(j-1))][j-1]);
that's how we build it;
and for query
we take intervla length
as j=R-L+1;
int k=log[j];
ans=min(min_r[L][k-1],min_r[R-(1<<(k-1))+1][k-1]);
as simple as that
(1<<(k-1)) this is small interval length and +1 after that is for this case
if k=1,L=1,R=2;
we need to divide range from L to L and R to R;
L to k-1 means L to (k-1)=0,means self 
next R-(1<<(k-1)) means R-1 which is equal to L
but we ndivided it from R to R right ,that's why +1
