1.)PRogram is a set of instructions stored in memory
2.)Process is a program in execution, Aprogram is called  process if it is executing right now,otherwise it's just program in memory
3.)A thread is a sub task of process, a process can have so many threads for different tasks, threads are light weight in nature,
imagine program as a set of instructions that's it
process means those instructions are getting executed,for some instructiosn our main process may create separate child processes (threads )all together, these child processes are called
threads.
4.)number of threads per user is governed by ulmit -u,in our case it is 65535
meeans this user is allowed to create a total of 65535 process that's it
if  a process created 10 threads right now, available limit = 65535-10 child process-1 main procees which created child process=65524;
