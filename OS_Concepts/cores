What are cores in a  cpu?
  cores are single independent processing unit of a cpu,it's like a mini cpu inside a cpu
  only one thread can bexecuted per core
if i have 128 core cpu, only 128 threads can be executed at any given time
wait, but siplb process creates 100's nhi 1000's of threads and they execute or atleast seem to execute parallelly?
  but my server has only 128 cores, so how is this happening?
  the thing is OS uses a time slicing and context switching,means let's assume two thread and one core
  thread1 will execute for t1,then thread2 will execute ,then again thread1 executes, The OS switches executing threads, so that every thread has time to
execute some part of it's tasks,it happens thousands of times per second, that's why, it feels like all threads are executing in parrallel
in reality only one thread can and will execute at any given time.

  Context Switching is  aprocess where the cpu stops executing one thread/process, saves it's state add it to queue and switches to another thread/process
Switching is managed by thread scheduler
cons:
takes time to save/load context,on every context switch
