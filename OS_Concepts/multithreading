Definition:
Multithreading is the ability of program to run multiple threads (independent tasks) concurrently,either truly parallel (like 8 threads, 9
9 cores) or through context switching.
advantages:
1.)non-blockig
2.)resource sharing
3.)faster execution
4.)Scalability
Concurrency:
Multiple tasks progressing over time, but not neccessarily at the exact time
9 tasks 8 cores ,concurrent
Parallellism:
Multiple tasks progressing at the same time
8 tasts 8 cores ,parallellism
