/here when streak breaks, we are not making current streak 0, because, when we reacha  new sequence of increasing
elements, we can simply subtract prefix[new_seq_end]-prefix[new_seq_begin], if we would have made that 0, when streak broke,
then we should have checked in between also, for naother streak break point, but now we could just directly subtract the prefix
streak,because we are carry frowarding the base streak also
