good question actually
https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/description/

here the key intuition let's assume every player is playing optimally, so if a players gain over other player is>=0 then,answer is true, otherwise false
so i need to have the max gain in each step,initially player has two options choose stat or end elment,
so calculate gain in both cases and return maximum, you may wonder what's the trick, the trick here is if i have taken start
then i am subtracting nums[start]-f(start+1,end)->step 1
in next step for calculation of f(start+1,end)
i could take either start+1, or end right
so all i do is 
max(nums[start+1]-f((start+2,end),nums[end]-f(start+1,end-1));->step 2
so the subtracting part in step 2(either f((start+2,end) or f(start+1,end-1)) is first player's gain
since i am subtracting it andd taking the maximum of this and subtracting that in step 1,player_1 curr_score-(max player_2curr_score))
i am essentially adding the player1 possibilities;
